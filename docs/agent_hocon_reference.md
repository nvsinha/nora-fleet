# Agent Network HOCON File Reference

This document describes the nora-fleet specifications for a single agent network .hocon file
as used for each [registry](../nora_fleet/registries)
in the [nora-fleet](https://github.com/nvsinha/nora-fleet) and [nora-studio](https://github.com/nvsinha/nora-studio)
repos.

The nora-fleet system uses the HOCON (Human-Optimized Config Object Notation) file format
for its data-driven configuration elements.  Very simply put, you can think of
.hocon files as JSON files that allow comments, but there is more to the hocon
format than that which you can explore on your own.

Specifications in this document each have header changes for the depth of scope of the dictionary header they pertain to.
Some key descriptions refer to values that are dictionaries.
Sub-keys to those dictionaries will be described in the next-level down heading scope from their parent.

Items in ***bold*** are essentials. Try to understand these first.

## Top-Level Agent Network Specifications

All parameters listed here have global scope (to the agent network) and are listed at the top of the file by convention.

### commondefs

A dictionary describing common definitions to be used throughout the particular agent network spec.

#### replacement_strings

A `commondefs` dictionary where keys are strings to be found within braces within strings
and the values of the dictionary are to replace those keys anywhere throughout the dictionary where string
values are to be found.  Example:

```json
{
    "commondefs": {
        "replacement_strings": {
            "operation": "addition",
            ...
        }
    }
    ...

        "instructions": "Perform the {operation} operation."
}
```

This results in a final interpretation where the `instructions` value is "Perform the addition operation."

Multiple passes are made for string replacements, so you can have string replacement values that also have
string replacement keys in them.

#### replacement_values

A `commondefs` dictionary where keys are strings to be found as full-values (no braces) and the values
of the dictionary are to replace those keys anywhere throughout the dictionary with the value defined
whenever an exact match of the string value is found.
values are to be found.  Example:

```json
{
    "commondefs": {
        "replacement_values": {
            "my_dict": {
                "key1": "my_value",
                "key2": 1.0
            }
            ...
        }
    }
    ...

        "function": "my_dict"
}
```

This results in a final interpretation where the `function` value is:

```json
"function": {
    "key1": "my_value",
    "key2": 1.0
}
```

Value replacement only happens once, but you can have replacement_strings references within
your string values within your replacement_values and things will work out as you might expect.

### llm_info_file

The `llm_info_file` key allows you to specify a custom HOCON file that extends the default list of available LLMs used
by agents in a nora-fleet network. This is especially useful if you're using models or providers that are not included in
the default configuration (e.g., newly released models or organization-specific endpoints).

This file is also the only source of model prices for token-cost reporting: set
[price_per_1k_input_tokens](./llm_info_hocon_reference.md#price_per_1k_input_tokens) and
[price_per_1k_output_tokens](./llm_info_hocon_reference.md#price_per_1k_output_tokens) for your models,
otherwise their reported cost defaults to 0 and a warning is logged.

For more information on selecting and customizing models, see the [model_name](#model_name) and [class](#class) section below.

### toolbox_info_file

The `toolbox_info_file` key lets you define a custom HOCON file that adds to the default set of tools available to agents
within a nora-fleet network. This is particularly helpful when you have tools shared across multiple agent networks.

For further details, refer to the [toolbox](#toolbox) section below.

### llm_config

An optional dictionary describing the default settings for agent LLMs when specifics
are not available for an given agent.  The default setting when this is not present
is to use an OpenAI gpt-4o model as the model_name for all agents.

#### model_name

The string model name to use for an agent in the network.
When this is not present, the default model is "gpt-4o" which is a decent all-purpose tool-using agent
which gets job done but doesn't cost a ton.

You can use any model listed in the [default_llm_info.hocon](../nora_fleet/internals/run_context/langchain/llms/default_llm_info.hocon)
file included with the nora-fleet distribution without any further modification.

While you can use any model you like for any agent within a nora-fleet agent network,
you will need to use a model that has been specifically trained for "tool use" for any agent that
branches off work to any other agent/tool.  You can browse the `capabilities` section of the
`default_llm_info.hocon` to be sure the llm you choose can use tools.

The most common situation is one where you will need your own access key set as an environment variable in order
to use LLMs from various providers.

| LLM Provider               | API Key environment variable                                 |
|:---------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Amazon Bedrock             | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, or AWS_PROFILE  |
| Anthropic                  | ANTHROPIC_API_KEY                                            |
| Anthropic via Bedrock      | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, or AWS_PROFILE  |
| Azure OpenAI               | AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY and AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT               |
| Google Gemini              | GOOGLE_API_KEY                                               |
| NVidia                     | NVIDIA_API_KEY                                               |
| Ollama                     | &lt;None required&gt;                                        |
| OpenAI                     | OPENAI_API_KEY                                               |
| OpenRouter                 | OPENROUTER_API_KEY                                           |

For the Bedrock-based entries you can either set explicit credentials via
`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (plus optional `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`
for temporary credentials), or point at a named profile in `~/.aws/credentials`
via `AWS_PROFILE`. Both classes resolve credentials through the standard AWS
credential chain, so SSO, EC2 instance roles, IMDS, and `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` /
`AWS_REGION` env vars all work the same way they do for any boto3 / anthropic-SDK
call.

**Anthropic Model Names:** The model names `claude-haiku`, `claude-sonnet`, `claude-opus`, and `claude-fable`
are aliases that automatically reference the latest versions of their respective Anthropic model lines.
This aliasing is recommended because Anthropic frequently deprecates older model versions. For information
on current models and deprecation schedules, see the
[Anthropic model deprecations documentation](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/about-claude/model-deprecations).

**OpenRouter Model Names:** [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a unified API gateway that fronts
hundreds of models from many providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, etc.) behind a single endpoint.
With the `openrouter` class, the `model_name` follows OpenRouter's `provider/model` convention, e.g.
`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5` or `openai/gpt-4o`. OpenRouter also exposes "meta-router" models such as
`openrouter/free` and `openrouter/auto` that select an underlying model at request time based on the
capabilities the request needs (image understanding, tool calling, structured outputs, etc.). Because
the underlying model is not known ahead of time for these routers, their `max_output_tokens` is left
unset in `default_llm_info.hocon` — see the
[llm_info_hocon_reference](./llm_info_hocon_reference.md#max_output_tokens) for what that means in practice.
This integration requires the [`langchain-openrouter`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/openrouter)
package, which nora-fleet lazy-installs on first use.

**Anthropic Claude on Bedrock — pick the right class:** AWS Bedrock can host Anthropic Claude models
under two different langchain classes, and nora-fleet wires up both:

- `anthropic-bedrock` (recommended for Claude) — built on the `anthropic` SDK's
  `AnthropicBedrock` / `AsyncAnthropicBedrock` clients. Fully async, and exposes
  `ChatAnthropic`'s full parameter surface (`thinking`, `effort`, `mcp_servers`,
  `context_management`, …).
- `bedrock` — the legacy boto3-based `ChatBedrock`. Synchronous and serializes concurrent
  calls inside a worker, and does not expose the Anthropic-specific knobs above. Reach for it
  only when you need a non-Anthropic Bedrock model (Amazon Nova, Mistral, Meta Llama, AI21,
  Cohere, etc.).

Bedrock addresses Claude models by cross-region inference profile id with a region prefix
(`global.`, `us.`, `eu.`, `apac.`), e.g. `global.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8` or
`us.anthropic.claude-opus-4-8`. The short aliases in `default_llm_info.hocon`
(`bedrock-claude-opus`, `bedrock-claude-sonnet`, `bedrock-claude-haiku`) all resolve to the
`global.` profile; swap the prefix on both the alias's `use_model_name` and the target entry
key to pin to a geographic region. See
[AWS cross-region inference docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/cross-region-inference.html)
for the trade-offs. The `anthropic-bedrock` class is provided by the
[`langchain-aws[anthropic]`](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/chat/bedrock#chatanthropicbedrock)
extra, which nora-fleet lazy-installs on first use.

**Security Best Practice:** _We strongly recommend to **not** set secrets as values within any source file._
These files tend to creep into source control repos, and it is **very** bad practice
to expose secrets by checking them in.

If your favorite model, or new hotness is not listed in `default_llm_info.hocon`,
you can still use it by specifying the [class](#class) key directly, or by extending the list in one of two ways:

(1) Set the absolute path to your extension HOCON file using the or
[llm_info_file](#llm_info_file) keys in the agent network HOCON file.

(2) Set the extension HOCON file to the environment variable
[AGENT_LLM_INFO_FILE](./llm_info_hocon_reference.md#AGENT_LLM_INFO_FILE-environment-variable).

For complete information on adding your own llm models or providers to the default llm info,
see the [llm_info_hocon_reference](./llm_info_hocon_reference.md).

#### Client-Provided API Keys

It is possible to set any one of the API keys described above as "sly_data" in the llm_config.
This will cause the system to look at the sly_data's llm_config dictionary for the appropriate
api key(s) depending on the model provider. Note that key names are all-smalls versions of any
environment variable names above.

See also: [llm_config](#llm_config-1) in the [sly_data_schema](#sly_data_schema-1) section.

Example networks that advertise that their sly_data_schema needs external API keys:

- [music_nerd_pro_sly_api_key.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/music_nerd_pro_sly_api_key.hocon)

#### temperature

Pretty much any of the LLMs will take a floating-point temperature parameter as an argument.
Roughly speaking, temperature is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates a relative amount of randomness
in answers provided by the LLM.  By default this value is 0.7.

#### Other LLM-specific Parameters

LLMs all come with various parameters like temperature that can be set on them.
As long as a parameter is a scalar listed in the args section for your LLM's class in the
[llm_info hocon file](../nora_fleet/internals/run_context/langchain/llms/default_llm_info.hocon)
file, you can set that parameter in any llm_config within its own technical limits however you like.

Note: _We strongly recommend to **not** set secrets as values within any source file, including hocon files._
These files tend to creep into source control repos, and it is **very** bad practice
to expose secrets by checking them in.

#### class

You can use the `class` key in two ways:

**1. For supported providers (predefined in `default_llm_info.hocon`)**

Set the `class` key to one of the values listed below, then specify the model using the `model_name` key.

| LLM Provider               | Class Value         |
|:---------------------------|:--------------------|
| Anthropic                  | anthropic           |
| Anthropic via Bedrock      | anthropic-bedrock   |
| Azure OpenAI               | azure-openai        |
| Bedrock (non-Anthropic)    | bedrock             |
| Google Gemini              | gemini              |
| NVidia                     | nvidia              |
| Ollama                     | ollama              |
| OpenAI                     | openai              |
| OpenRouter                 | openrouter          |

You may only provide parameters that are explicitly defined for that provider's class under the
`classes.<class>.args` section of
[`default_llm_info.hocon`](../nora_fleet/internals/run_context/langchain/llms/default_llm_info.hocon).
Unsupported parameters will be ignored

**2. For custom providers (not in `default_llm_info.hocon`)**

Set the `class` key to the full Python path of the desired LangChain-compatible chat model class in the format:

```hocon
<langchain_package>.<module>.<ChatModelClass>
```

Then, provide any constructor arguments supported by that class in `llm_config`.

For a full list of available chat model classes and their parameters, refer to:
[LangChain Chat Integrations Documentation](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/chat/)

> _Note: Nora Fleet requires models that support **tool-calling** capabilities._

#### fallbacks

Fallbacks is a list of [llm_config](#llm_config) dictionaries to use in priority order.
When the an llm_config in the list fails for any reason, the next in the list is tried.

An simple example usage is given in [esp_decision_assistant.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/esp_decision_assistant.hocon).

You cannot have fallbacks listed within fallbacks.

### verbose

Controls server-side logging of agent chatter.

By default this is false, indicating no server-side logging is desired.
When true, basic langchain AgentExecutor verbosity is turned on for the agent.
There is an `extra` level of logging which enables a lanchain LoggingCallbackHandler for the agent.

Whenever any logging is turned on, it can be quite chatty, so this is not really a setting appropriate
for a production environment.  It's worth noting that most of the same information obtained by turning
on verbose can also be obtained by AGENT ChatMessages returned when the client's chat_filter is set to
MAXIMAL.

### max_steps

An integer that sets the [recursion limit](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#recursion-limit)
for LangGraph's agent. Despite its name, the recursion limit acts as a
[super-step](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langgraph/graph-api#graphs) limit
on the entire graph execution, encompassing all tool and LLM calls.
Nodes that run in parallel share the same super-step,
while sequential nodes each occupy a separate super-step. Defaults to 10,000.

### max_iterations

Deprecated. Use [max_steps](#max_steps) instead.

### max_execution_seconds

An integer controlling the maximum amount of wall clock time (in seconds) to spend in the langchain
[AgentExecutor](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/latest/agents/langchain.agents.agent.AgentExecutor.html)
used for the agent.  Default is set for 5 minutes.

### max_attempts

A positive integer (i.e. >= 1) indicating the maximum number of times to attempt an agent run given any failures.
This is different from [max_steps](#max_steps) in that it specifically relates to retryable errors encountered
during agent execution as opposed to limiting the number of super-steps.

A "retryable" error here includes LLM provider API errors pertaining to rate limits, timeouts,
and other temporary failures.  Failures which are known to be non-retryable are not re-attempted.
These include API_KEY errors, ValueErrors from tools, and other unexpected exceptions; the idea
being: these errors would just happen again anyway so why waste the tokens?

The default setting is to use 3 attempts.

### request_timeout_seconds

An integer controlling the maximum amount of wall clock time (in seconds) to wait for any single
client-side chat request to finish. When this time is exceeded, the request is aborted and a timeout error
is reported back to the client.  Default is set for 0 seconds, which indicates no timeout.

### error_formatter

String value which describes which error formatter to use by default for any agent in the network.

The default value is `string` which indicates that when errors occur, they are reported upstream
in their original string format.

An alternative value here is `json`, which formats the error output into a predictable json dictionary
which contains the following keys:

| Error Dictionary Key | Description |
|:---------------------|:------------|
| error     | The error message itself, usually from a Python exception |
| tool      | The name of the tool within the agent network that generated the error |
| details   | Optional string descibing details of the error. Could include a Traceback, for instance|

### error_fragments

A list of strings where if any one of the strings appears in agent output,
it is considered an error and reported as such per the [error_formatter](#error_formatter).

#### sly_data_schema

The optional [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) dictionary describing what
specific information the agent needs as input arguments over the private sly_data dictionary
channel when it is called.  The sly_data itself is generally considered to be private information
that does not belong in the chat stream, for example: credential information.

This is a "global" definition of sly_data_schema that will be merged with any tool-specific definition.
While this is intended only for use with a front-man agent only, it can sometimes be useful to
have partial definitions for sly_data_schema that pertain to all agent networks in the manifest
defined globally with this key while network-specific definitions can be defined with the `sly_data_schema`
key within the front-man tool.

For more details, see the [sly_data_schema](#sly_data_schema-1) key below.

### tools

A list/array of [single agent specifications](#single-agent-specification) that make up the agent network.

The first of these in the list is called the "Front Man".
He handles all the dealings with any client of the agent network.

Other agents listed can be in any order and can reference each other, forming trees or graphs.

Typically any agent that is not the front-man is considered an implementation detail private
to the agent network definition. It is not possible to call these internal agents except from within
the agent network that defines them.  If you find your agent networks have some shared functionality
between them, consider elevating sub-networks to [external agent](#external-agents) status.

### metadata

An optional dictionary containing metadata about the agent network.
Any metadata is by definition merely informational and non-functional.
At least some of the keys mentioned below can be transmitted back to a Concierge service client

#### description

A string description of the agent network.

#### tags

A list of strings that describe grouping attributes of the agent network.
The idea here is that any given server can describe groupings of agent networks
however it wants to.

#### sample_queries

A list of sample query strings that can be asked of the agent network.
These queries serve as examples to help users understand what kinds of questions or requests
are appropriate for the agent network.

## Single Agent Specification

Settings for individual agents are specified by their own dictionary within the list of [tools](#tools) for the network.

There are a few settings that only apply to the front man.

### name

Every agent _must_ have a name.

Names can contain alphanumeric characters with "-" or "_" as word separators.
No spaces or other punctuation is allowed.
This allows for snake_case, camelCase, kebab-case, PascalCase, or SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
human-readable names, however you like them.

Any agent can refer to any other agent definition within the same agent network hocon file
by using its name in its [tools](#tools-agents) list.

### function

A dictionary which describes what an agent can do and how it wishes to be invoked for the
benefit of its upstream caller's planning.

Nora Fleet largely follows the
[OpenAI function spec](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling?api-mode=responses#defining-functions),
however we do not require redefining the `name` (that is already given [above](#name))
and we also do not require redefining the `type` as this is always the same for every agent.

What is defined in this dictionary is what is returned for the agent's Function() nora-fleet web API call.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
#### description

Every agent _must_ have its function description filled out.
This is a single string value which informs anything upstream as to what _this_ agent can do for it.

For a user-facing front-man, what is contained in this description often suffices as a prompt for the user.

#### parameters

Parameters contains an optional [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) dictionary describing what
specific information the agent needs as input arguments when it is called.
Only the `type: object` + `properties` form described below is supported.
JSON Schema constructs outside this form (such as `additionalProperties`,
`anyOf`, or `$ref`) are not honored: a schema without a `properties` dictionary
is rejected as invalid when the agent is called as a tool, and unsupported
constructs appearing alongside a `properties` dictionary are ignored.

A front-man typically does not need parameters defined when its agent network is only
ever talked to directly by a user.

When the agent network is anticipated as being called from other agent networks
(that is, referenced as an external tool), the front-man's parameters are how a
calling agent passes its request along — the tool-call arguments are the only message
channel through which a caller's request reaches the external network.
(Private data can separately flow through the opt-in `sly_data` channel —
see [to_downstream](#to_downstream).) Declare at least one parameter
(for example, a single required `inquiry` string) for any network intended to be
referenced externally. If no parameters are declared, nora-fleet synthesizes a default
required `inquiry` string parameter on the calling side (and logs a warning) so the
caller's request still gets through.

##### type

The type of the parameters dictionary is always `object`.
This lets the parsing system know that the [properties](#properties) will be described as a dictionary.

##### properties

A dictionary whose keys each describe the name of a single argument to be used as input to an agent.
Each key's value is a dictionary describing the single argument value itself.
This dictionary has the following keys:

| Property Key | Description |
|:-------------|:------------|
| description  | A string which describes the particular argument |
| type         | A string describing the type of the property. (See below) |
| default      | An optional default value for the property |

Scalar types here can be "int" or "integer", "float", "number" (accepts both
integers and floats), "string", and "bool" or "boolean".
These include the standard JSON Schema spellings, so function specs copied from
OpenAI- or MCP-style tool definitions work as-is.
It is possible that a properties' type can be "array"s for lists or "object"s for nested dictionaries.
An "array" property must also carry an "items" dictionary describing the type of its elements.

Any sample agent hocon with more than one agent will have some example of a simple properties dictionary.
For a concrete, more complex properties definition, with nested objects and arrays,
See the definition of [cao_item in the esp_descision_assistant.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/esp_decision_assistant.hocon).

##### required

This is an optional list of string keys in the [properties](#properties) dictionary that are considered
to be required whenever an upstream agent calls the one being described.
Note that it's possible to specify a default value for any property that is not listed as required.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
#### sly_data_schema

The optional [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) dictionary describing what
specific information the agent needs as input arguments over the private sly_data dictionary
channel when it is called.  The sly_data itself is generally considered to be private information
that does not belong in the chat stream, for example: credential information.

The sly_data_schema specification here has the same format as the [parameters](#parameters)
schema definition above.  Ideally there should be one [properties](#properties) entry per
sly_data dictionary input key, and any absolutely necessary keys should be listed in the [required](#required)
list.

Note that it is not always strictly necessary to advertise to the outside world the sly_data_schema that
your agent network requires, but doing so does allow generic clients to prompt for this extra
information before sending any chat input.

The front-man is the only agent node that ever needs to specify this aspect of the [function](#function)
definition, as sly_data itself is already visible to all other internal agents of the network.

Example networks that advertise their sly_data_schema:

- [math_guy.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/math_guy.hocon)
- [music_nerd_pro_sly_api_key.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/music_nerd_pro_sly_api_key.hocon)

There are select few tacit conventions supported for certain sly_data values that need to come from the client:

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
##### llm_config

The sly_data dictionary can contain an optional `llm_config` key whose value is a dictionary
containing per-user API keys to be filled in when an agent's llm_config has certain values
specified as "sly_data" for its values.

This enables any or all agent networks to potentially offload the costs operation onto the user
by having the user fill in their own API keys.

Any key in this dictionary will be specific to a particular LLM (i.e. "openai_api_key" or "anthropic_api_key").

Example networks that advertise that their sly_data_schema needs external API keys:

- [music_nerd_pro_sly_api_key.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/music_nerd_pro_sly_api_key.hocon)

##### http_headers

The sly_data dictionary can contain an optional `http_headers` key: a mapping from
[MCP server](#mcp-servers) URL to a dictionary of HTTP header names/values (for example
`{"Authorization": "Bearer <token>"}`) that nora-fleet sends when it calls that server.
See [Authentication](#authentication) under MCP Servers for the header format.

Advertising `http_headers` in your `sly_data_schema` — with a `properties` entry per MCP URL and a
`required` list — lets an OAuth-capable client (for example
[nora-flow](https://github.com/nvsinha/nora-flow)) run the sign-in flow, inject the resulting
bearer token into sly_data on the user's behalf, and prompt the user to connect any URL listed under
`http_headers.required` before chatting. nora-fleet itself only defines the schema and forwards
whatever `http_headers` arrive in sly_data; the OAuth flow and the connect prompt are the client's
responsibility.

#### sly_data_output_schema

Similar optional dictionary to [sly_data_schema](#sly_data_schema-1) above, but this specifies the schema
for the sly_data being output by the agent network.

Example networks that advertise their sly_data_output_schema:

- [math_guy.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/math_guy.hocon)

#### invocation

_Front Man only_
A string describing how the agent is to be called.

A value of "chatbot" (the default) indicates that the agent is intended to be called as a chatbot,
which essentially means the caller will be waiting for the agent network to complete
the conversation in order to get some kind of response.  If the caller disconnects, the
work being done for the request will be abandoned.

A value of "event" indicates that the agent is intended to be called as an event handler,
where the caller will _not_ be waiting for the agent network to complete the conversation.
Rather, the caller reports information to the agent network, receives a quick acknowledgment
message that the information has been received and the network's processing continues after
the caller disconnects.  Events can also be called periodically by configuration in the manifest.
See the [periodic key in the manifest documentation](./manifest_hocon_reference.md#periodic) for
more information.

### instructions

When included, the single (often very long) string value here tells an LLM-enabled agent
what it needs to do.

This is optional because not every tool listed in the agent network uses an LLM (there exist CodedTools).
But if you expect an agent to use an LLM, this instructions field is a must.

### command

An optional string to set an LLM-enabled agent in motion.

### tools (agents)

An optional list defining which tools or agents the described agent can access.
Each entry may be one of the following:

- The name of another agent within the same network definition.

- A string reference to an [external agent](#external-agents)

- A string or dictionary reference to an [MCP server](#mcp-servers)

Typically the names listed here are other agents within the same agent network definition,
often forming a tree structure, but overall agent networks are allowed to contain cycles.

It is important to note that just because an agent is listed in the tools does not mean that it will always
be called by an LLM.  The tools listing is merely a full description of what is _available_ to the agent.
It is the agent itself that actually decides which tools (if any) to invoke depending on its instructions
and the context of its query.

#### External Agents

This is not a hocon file key, but more a description of a concept that relates to listings of tools.

It is possible for any agent to reference another agent on the same server by adding a forward-slash
in front of the served agent's name.  This is typically the stem of an agent network hocon file in
a deployment's registries directory.

Example: `/date_time` or `/math_guy`

This allows common agent network definitions to be used as functions for other local networks.

Furthermore, it is also possible to reference agents on other nora-fleet _servers_ by using a URL as a tool reference.

Example: `http://localhost:8080/math_guy`

This enables entire ecosystems of agent webs.

#### MCP Servers

Agents can call tools exposed by external Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

MCP server URLs are recognized when they conform to the
[MCP canonical server URI specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-11-25/basic/authorization#canonical-server-uri):
they must use the `http` or `https` scheme, must include a host, and must not contain a fragment.
To distinguish MCP server URLs from other external agent URLs, the literal `mcp` must appear either
as a label in the hostname (e.g. `mcp.example.com`) or as any segment of the URL path
(e.g. `/mcp`, `/mcp/free`, `/server/mcp`, `/v1/mcp/server`).

Examples of URLs that are recognized as MCP servers:

- `https://mcp.example.com/mcp`
- `https://mcp.example.com`
- `https://mcp.example.com:8443`
- `https://example.com/mcp/free`
- `https://example.com/v1/mcp/server`
- `http://localhost:8000/mcp/`

If a URL you want to use does not satisfy these rules, fall back to the dictionary form below,
which is always treated as an MCP reference regardless of URL shape.

MCP servers can be configured in two formats:

- string reference

    ```json
    "tools": ["https://example.com/mcp"]
    ```

    - Tool filtering is not available with string reference format unless using environment variable
    `MCP_SERVERS_INFO_FILE` (see Authentication section below).

- dictionary reference

    ```json
    "tools": [
        {
            "url": "https://example.com/mcp",
            "tools": ["tool_1"]
        }
    ]
    ```

    - `tools` key filters which specific tools from the MCP server are made available.
    If omitted, all tools on the server will be accessible.

##### Authentication

MCP tools can be authenticated using the following methods:

- `http_headers` field in `sly_data`. The required fields depend on the authentication scheme expected by each MCP
server. Users may specify different authorization credentials for different MCP URLs.

    Example:

    ```json
    {
        "http_headers": {
            "<MCP_URL_1>": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer <token_value>"
            },
            "<MCP_URL_2>": {
                "client_id": "<client_id_value>",
                "client_secret": "<client_secret_value>"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

- Set the `MCP_SERVERS_INFO_FILE` environment variable to point to a HOCON file containing MCP server configurations:

    ```json
    {
        "mcp_server_url_1": {
            "http_headers": {
                "Authorization": "Bearer <token>",
            },
            "tools": ["tool_1", "tool_2"]
        },
    }
    ```

    - Server URLs must match those in the agent network HOCON file

    - If the headers exist in both `sly_data` and the configuration file for the same server,
    `sly_data` takes precedence

    - Tool filtering from the configuration file is used only if no tool filtering exists in the agent network HOCON

A client can also populate these `http_headers` on the user's behalf: see [http_headers](#http_headers)
under `sly_data_schema`, where a network advertises the MCP URLs it needs and an OAuth-capable client
(e.g. nora-flow) signs in and injects the bearer token, gating on `http_headers.required`.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
### llm_config

It is possible for any LLM-enabled agent description to also have its own [llm_config](#llm_config)
dictionary.  This allows for agents to use the right agent for the job.
Some considerations might include:

- Use of lower-cost LLMs for lighter (perhaps non-tool-using) jobs
- Use of specially trained LLMs when subject matter expertise is required.
- Use of securely sequestered LLMs when sensitive information is appropos to a single agent's chat stream.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
### class

Optional string specifying a Python class which implements the
[CodedTool](../nora_fleet/interfaces/coded_tool.py)
interface.

<!-- pyml disable no-inline-html -->
Implementations can be specified as a fully-qualified class name, as long as that is in your PYTHONPATH.

OR, to contribute to hocon brevity, there is a shortcut ...

Implementations must be found in the directory where the class can be resolved by looking
under the `AGENT_TOOL_PATH` environment variable setting as part of the `PYTHONPATH`.
By default, nora-fleet deployments assume that `PYTHONPATH` is set to contain the
top-level of your project's repo and that `AGENT_TOOL_PATH` is set to `<top-level>/coded_tools`.
In that directory each agent has its own folder and the value of the class is resolved
from there:  `<top-level>/coded_tools/<agent-name>`.  If there is no appropriate class found there,
then a shared coded tool is looked for one level up in `<top-level>/coded_tools`.
<!-- pyml enable no-inline-html -->

For example:
If the agent is called `math_guy` and the class is valued as `calculator.Calculator`,
The python file math_guy/calculator.py under `AGENT_TOOL_PATH` is expected to have
a class called Calculator which implements the CodedTool interface.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Loading a class imports its module, and importing a module executes the module's top-level code.
> Because agent network hocon files can name classes to load, hocon files and coded tools are
> code-equivalent: anyone who can write to the registry directory or `AGENT_TOOL_PATH` can
> effectively run code as the server process. Restrict write access to both locations, review
> registry changes as you would code changes, and prefer least-privilege deployments.
>
> Setting the `AGENT_TOOL_PATH_ONLY` environment variable to `true` (default `false`) hardens the
> CodedTool `class` path specifically: fully-qualified references are no longer resolved, so a
> CodedTool `class` resolves only under the `AGENT_TOOL_PATH` hierarchy described above and cannot
> import an arbitrary module elsewhere on the `PYTHONPATH`. The same flag governs shared coded
> tools referenced through the [toolbox](#toolbox). It does **not** restrict other class references
> an agent network can make — `llm_config.class`, middleware classes, and langchain toolbox tool
> classes are still resolved fully-qualified — so it narrows one vector rather than replacing the
> trust boundary above. When the flag is off, the server logs a one-time notice at first CodedTool
> resolution that resolution is unrestricted.

Implementations of the CodedTool interface must have implementations which:

- have a no-args constructor
- implement either the preferred `async_invoke()` or the discouraged synchronous `invoke()` method.

Agents representing CodedTools have the arguments described their [function parameters](#parameters)
populated by calling LLMs and passed in via the args dictionary of their async/invoke() method
when they are invoked.  They are also passed the sly_data dictionary which contains
private information not accessable to the chat stream.

Note that the CodedTool also has a synchronous invoke() method, but we discourage its use,
as nora-fleet is expected to run in an asynchronous multi-threaded environment.
Using synchronous I/O calls within CodedTool implementations will result in loss of per-request
agent parallelism and performance problems at scale.

### toolbox

An optional string that refers to a predefined tool listed in a toolbox configuration file.
Currently supported tool types include:

- langchain's base tools
- coded tools.

The default toolbox configuration is located at [toolbox_info.hocon](../nora_fleet/internals/run_context/langchain/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon).

To use your own tools, create a custom toolbox `.hocon` file and reference it in one of the following ways:

- Setting the `toolbox_info_file` key in the agent network `.hocon` file.
- Defining the `AGENT_TOOLBOX_INFO_FILE` environment variable.

For more details on tool extension, see the [Toolbox Extension Guide](./toolbox_info_hocon_reference.md#extending-toolbox-info).

For more information on tool schema, see the [toolbox_info_hocon_reference](./toolbox_info_hocon_reference.md).

Note that an agent using `toolbox` cannot have a `tools` field. A toolbox agent executes code directly
rather than calling an LLM, so it cannot invoke other tools as downstream agents.

Example networks using tools from toolbox:

- [date_time_timezone.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/date_time_timezone.hocon) which uses predefined
coded tools.

### args

Args is an optional dictionary for agents representing CodedTools to pass other
key/value pairs when the agent is invoked.  This allows for greater code sharing
for a single CodedTool implementation when it is referenced by multiple agents
and called in multiple contexts. It can also be used to supply or override arguments of Langchain tools defined in the [toolbox](#toolbox).

#### tools (args)

CodedTools are allowed to call out to other tools programmatically when they also derive from the BranchActivation
class within nora-fleet. In order to allow for discovery of these connections to other agents by validation processes
and Connectivity() calls, by convention we expect a tools dictionary to be specified in the args for the tool that
defines which agents _might_ be called.  The keys can be any string you want, and the values are tools that
can be called as a result of the CodedTool being invoked.

### allow

An optional dictionary which controls security policy pertaining to agent information flow.

#### connectivity

Boolean value which allows any agent within the network specification to control whether or
not to report any downstream tools during a Connectivity() API call, which allow for
pre-rendering of agent networks for demo/light-show purposes.

The default value of true says "sure, report all my downstream tools".
A false value does not allow such reporting.

Turning this value to false at the front-man prevents any connectivity reporting from happening.
Mid-level agents can have this be false to hide certain implementation details.

#### to_downstream

Dictionary which specifies security policy for information go _to_ downstream [external agents](#external-agents).
This has no effect on any information flowing between agents internal to the network.

##### sly_data

By default no sly_data goes out to any external agent.
To transmit sly_data to an external agent, you _must_ specificaly enable it.

A dictionary value whose keys represent keys in the sly_data dictionary.
Boolean values for each key tell whether or not that data is allowed to go through to external agents.
A string value in the dictionary represents a translation to a new key.

Example:

```json
    "allow": {
        "to_downstream": {
            "sly_data": {
                "user_id": true,
                "user_ssn": false,
                "my_session": "session_id"
            }
        }
    }
```

In simple sly_data situations you can simply specify which keys you want to allow
as a list:

```json
    "allow": {
        "to_downstream": {
            "sly_data": [ "user_id", "session_id" ]
        }
    }
```

#### from_downstream

Dictionary which specifies security policy for information coming _from_ downstream [external agents](#external-agents).
This has no effect on any information flowing between agents internal to the network.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
##### sly_data

By default no sly_data is accepted from any external agent.
To accept sly_data from an external agent, you _must_ specificaly enable it.

A dictionary value whose keys represent keys in the sly_data dictionary.
Boolean values for each key tell whether or not that data from any external agent
is allowed to be accepted and merged into this agent's sly_data.
A string value in the dictionary represents a translation to a new key.

The same dictionary/list specification described in [to_downstream](#sly_data) also applies here.

##### messages

By default, external agent messages coming from downstream are not forwarded
to the client via the calling agent network. Usually, all an agent really cares about is:
"What was the answer text/json?" and "What sly_data needs to be integrated?"
But there are some cases where it's advantageuos to forward messages from downstream
external networks to the client, and that is what this key is for.

There are several forms this key can take which have varying levels of control:

- boolean - true/false value that controls whether or not to forward messages from
            any and all downstream external agents.  The default is false.
- string - a string value that represents a single external agent reference
           (as it appears in the tool list) whose messages should be forwarded.
           This is akin to turning on the boolean value to true for a single agent.
- list of strings - a list of external agent references (as they appear in the tool list)
           whose messages should be forwarded.  This is akin to turning on the boolean value
           to true for multiple agents.
- dictionary - a dictionary whose keys are external agent references (as they
           appear in the tool list) and whose values are boolean values that control
           whether or not to forward messages from that agent.

Example networks that pass through their external agent messages:

- [math_guy_passthrough.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/math_guy_passthrough.hocon)

#### to_upstream

_Front Man only_
Dictionary which specifies security policy for information going back to any calling client.

This has no effect on any information flowing between agents internal to the network.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
##### sly_data

By default no sly_data goes back to the upstream caller from the agent network
To transmit sly_data to its upstream caller, you _must_ specificaly enable it.

A dictionary value whose keys represent keys in the sly_data dictionary.
Boolean values for each key tell whether or not that data internal to the agent network
is allowed to go back to the client in the final message.
A string value in the dictionary represents a translation to a new key.

The same dictionary/list specification described in [to_downstream](#sly_data) also applies here.

#### to_tracing

_Front Man only_
Dictionary which specifies security policy for information going to tracing applications.

This has no effect on any information flowing between agents internal to the network.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
##### sly_data

By default sly_data keys appear in messages going to tracing applications, but the values are `<redacted>`.
To transmit sly_data values to a tracing application, you _must_ specifically enable it.

A dictionary value whose keys represent keys in the sly_data dictionary.
Boolean values for each key tell whether or not that data internal to the agent network
is allowed to go to the tracing application in the message that is reported there.
A string value in the dictionary represents a translation to a new key.

The same dictionary/list specification described in [to_downstream](#sly_data) also applies here.

### display_as

An optional string that describes how the agent node wishes to appear to a client
that can visualize the network's connectivity.

When not present, the system determines the value given the configuration of the node
and will return one of the following strings:

- external_agent - for [External Agents](#external-agents)
- coded_tool - for a [CodedTool](../nora_fleet/interfaces/coded_tool.py)
- langchain_tool - for a langchain tool
- llm_agent - for LLM-powered agents

### max_message_history

<!-- pyml disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
_Front Man only_

An integer which tells the server how many of the most recent chat history messages
to send back in its chat_context field which allows for continuing a conversation
on the next client invocation.  By default this value is None, indicating there is no limit.

This is useful when end-user conversations with agents are expected to be lengthy and/or change
topics frequently.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
### verbose

Same as top-level [verbose](#verbose), except at single-agent scope.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
### max_steps

Same as top-level [max_steps](#max_steps), except at single-agent scope.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
### max_iterations

Deprecated. Use [max_steps](#max_steps-1) instead.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
### max_execution_seconds

Same as top-level [max_execution_seconds](#max_execution_seconds), except at single-agent scope.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
### max_attempts

Same as top-level [max_attempts](#max_attempts), except at single-agent scope.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
### error_formatter

Same as top-level [error_formatter above](#error_formatter), except at single-agent scope.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
### error_fragments

Same as top-level [error_fragments above](#error_fragments), except at single-agent scope.

### structure_formats

<!-- pyml disable-next-line no-emphasis-as-heading -->
_Front Man only_

An optional list of strings describing the formats that the server-side should
parse into the structure field of the ChatMessage response so clients do not have
to re-invent this parsing wheel multiple times over.

The first single structure found of the appropriate format(s) from the text of a response
is what is put into the ChatMessage structure field, and any text which contributed to the
parsing of that structure is removed from the ChatMessage text field.

Supported values are:

- `json`    Looks for JSON in the messages from the LLM and extracts

Currently, the front-man is the only agent node that ever needs to specify this aspect of the [function](#function)
definition.

Example networks that parse their structure_formats:

- [music_nerd_pro.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/music_nerd_pro.hocon)

### middleware

An optional list of dictionaries which describes AgentMiddleware instances to be applied to the agent.
Note that the order of appearance in the list can matter.

For an overview of middleware, see the [Overview](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/middleware/overview).

Example networks that parse their structure_formats:

- [pii_middleware.hocon](../nora_fleet/registries/pii_middleware.hocon)

Each middleware dictionary in the list can contain the following keys:

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
#### class

_required_
The fully-qualified class name of the langchain AgentMiddleware class to be instantiated.

AgentMiddleware allows for calling code to be executed in the following situations:
- before the agent execution starts (abefore_agent())
- after the agent execution starts (aafter_agent())
- before the LLM is called (abefore_model())
- after the LLM is called (aafter_model())
- intercept and control async model execution (awrap_model_call())
- intercept and control async tool execution (awrap_tool_call())

We list the asynchronous methods here as those are preferred in the asynchronous environment of
a Nora Fleet server.

Note that we only support class-based middleware and not annotations-based middleware.
See [AgentMiddleware](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/middleware/custom#class-based-middleware)
for details.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
#### args

A dictionary of keyword arguments to be passed to the specified AgentMiddleware class constructor.

Keys of the dictionary are the argument names and values are the argument values.
These will depend on the constructor signature of the class you are trying to instantiate.

There are some special args that will be populated with information provided by the agent framework
if they are specified in both the middleware dictionary and the class constructor signature:

##### chat_history

A list of langchain BaseMessages that are the full history of the conversation so far for the Middleware's agent.
We allow this because some middleware may need to inspect and/or modify the history that nora-fleet keeps
as per-agent state (Think: summarization middleware).

##### origin

A list of dictionaries that describe the origin of the middleware instantiation in terms of
where it is in the hierarchy of the agent network.

##### origin_str

A simpler string representation of the [origin](#origin)

##### progress_reporter

A ProgressReporter instance that can be used to report progress dictionaries via the chat stream.

<!--- pyml disable-next-line no-duplicate-heading -->
##### sly_data

The agent's sly_data dictionary which is common to all middleware and coded tools for the request.
