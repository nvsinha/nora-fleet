    Policy for the up-front delay applied before serving a cache hit during
    playback/hybrid, emulating how long the real LLM took to respond. This is
    distinct from inter-frame stream pacing (stream_replay_delay).

    Delay policies:
      none     -- no delay (serve immediately).
      recorded -- use the response's own recorded wall-clock latency: for
                  streams the time-to-first-token (first_byte_seconds), falling
                  back to total latency_seconds for one-shot responses. In
                  multi-response playback each rotated response carries its own
                  latency, so each is delayed by exactly what it took to record.
