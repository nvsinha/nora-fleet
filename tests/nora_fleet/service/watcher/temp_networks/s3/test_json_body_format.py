S3ReservationsStorage commits to a specific on-disk format for every
reservation it writes:
  - Serialization is JSON (we chose json.dumps, not pickle/yaml/proto).
  - The original agent_spec lives at the top level of the document
    (no wrap-in-envelope like {"data": ...}).
  - Storage-injected bookkeeping fields live under a "metadata" key
    ("reservation" with the serialized Reservation, "stored_at" with
    the wall-clock timestamp).

External consumers (CLI tools, dashboards, debugging operators) read
these objects directly and rely on the format being stable. T1's
round-trip would still pass if the read+write paths were updated
together but the on-disk format silently changed; this module pins
the format by reading the raw bytes and validating the parsed
document against a JSON Schema, independent of the storage's read
path.

Encoding/line-ending properties (UTF-8, no BOM, no CRLF) are
boto3+Python concerns and are intentionally NOT tested here.
