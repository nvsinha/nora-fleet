S3ReservationsStorage.iter_reservation_keys() pages through S3 by
calling list_objects_v2 directly with ContinuationToken, with each
call wrapped in _do_with_retries. This module exercises that retry
behavior: a transient ThrottlingException on the first page-fetch
attempt is retried, the retry succeeds, pagination continues, and the
listing yields every key in order.
