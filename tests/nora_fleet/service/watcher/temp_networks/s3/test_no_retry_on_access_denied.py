S3ReservationsStorage._is_retryable_client_error classifies errors
into retryable (transient: throttling, slow-down, 5xx) and
non-retryable (permanent: AccessDenied, malformed request, etc.).
This module exercises the non-retryable branch: an AccessDenied
ClientError must propagate immediately, with no S3 mutation and
nothing retrievable through the public read path.
