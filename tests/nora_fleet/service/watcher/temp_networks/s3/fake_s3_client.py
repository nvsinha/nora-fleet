"""
In-memory stand-in for a boto3 S3 client used by the
S3ReservationsStorage unit tests. Implements only the methods
the storage actually calls, storing object bodies in a dict
keyed by S3 object key. Method signatures use boto3's
PascalCase keyword arguments so the storage's call sites work
unchanged.

Pytest's default test-file pattern is test_*.py, so this file
(which does not start with "test_") is not collected as a test
module.

          * Keys are returned in lexicographic (UTF-8 binary) order, which is
            what real S3 guarantees. Tests can therefore control the sweep's
            processing order by choosing key names (e.g. "a-poison" sorts
            before "z-expired").
          * When no keys match, the "Contents" key is omitted entirely; real
            S3 omits it for empty result sets rather than returning [].
          * Everything fits in one page (IsTruncated=False). Multi-page
            behavior is exercised separately with a MagicMock side_effect
            (see test_retry_on_listing_pagination.py), so this fake does not
            implement ContinuationToken threading.
