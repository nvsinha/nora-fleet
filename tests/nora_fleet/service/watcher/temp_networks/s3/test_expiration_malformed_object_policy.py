"""
Pins the expiration sweep's policy for objects under the reservations/
prefix whose bodies are valid JSON but are NOT shaped like a reservation
(no metadata.reservation dict with a numeric expiration_time_in_seconds).

Such objects are how the "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'"
errors reported from production arise: the bucket is long-lived and
shared across code versions, so it can contain objects written by an
older schema, by other tooling, or by a since-fixed writer bug.

Three policies were considered before the current one:

  1. Raise: the sweep crashes at the first malformed key, the watcher
     retries next interval and crashes at the same key again - so ONE
     bad object stops ALL expiration, forever, while logging the
     NoneType error every cycle.
  2. Treat as expired and delete immediately: DictionaryExtractor
     defaults make a missing expiration_time read as 0, current_time > 0
     is always true, and the object is PERMANENTLY DELETED with only a
     debug-level log naming reservation '<unknown>'. That silently
     destroys any object the current code merely fails to understand
     (e.g. schema drift during a rolling deploy, where an old server's
     sweep would delete a new server's live reservations), and it
     destroys the only evidence of whatever wrote the bad object.
  3. Skip and warn forever: safe for the data and the sweep, but
     unparseable detritus builds up and gets re-read and re-logged on
     every pass (review feedback on the first draft of this policy).

The pinned policy is AGE-GATED deletion: an unparseable object is
skipped with a WARNING while younger than
S3ReservationsExpiration.MALFORMED_OBJECT_GRACE_SECONDS, and deleted
with a WARNING once older. Every reservation has a bounded lifetime, so
an object older than any possible lifetime cannot be a live reservation
under ANY schema version - deleting it is safe and bounds the detritus,
while the grace window keeps rolling-deploy schema drift from
destroying live reservations and gives humans time to notice the
warnings.

NOTE on coverage vs the alternatives: immediate deletion (policy 2)
fails test_young_wrong_shape_object_is_not_deleted; skip-forever
(policy 3) fails test_old_wrong_shape_object_is_deleted; raising
(policy 1) fails test_null_reservation_object_does_not_kill_sweep,
because DictionaryExtractor returns a stored JSON null in preference to
its default, which put naive extractor-based handling right back into
policy 1's death spiral.
