    Base TestCase that exercises the reservation feature through
    S3ReservationsStorage by injecting an in-memory FakeS3Client. No real
    AWS, no LocalStack, no extra dependencies.

    Concrete subclasses add focused test_* methods. This class is named so
    that it does NOT begin with "Test" and therefore is not discovered
    directly by pytest; only subclasses with a "Test" prefix run.

    See S3ReservationsStorage.add_reservations docstring for the on-disk
    JSON schema written to S3.

    A subtle point not captured in that schema: AgentNetwork.name is
    assigned in memory at read time (= the lookup id passed to
    get_one_reservation), and is NOT a field in the JSON.
