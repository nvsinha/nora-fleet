"""
In-memory stand-in for a boto3 S3 client used by the
S3ReservationsStorage unit tests. Implements only the methods
the storage actually calls, storing object bodies in a dict
keyed by S3 object key. Method signatures use boto3's
PascalCase keyword arguments so the storage's call sites work
unchanged.

Pytest's default test-file pattern is test_*.py, so this file
(which does not start with "test_") is not collected as a test
module.
