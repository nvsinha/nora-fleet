Pins credential recovery on the reservation WRITE path: a deployment
batch whose first attempt fails against a bad credential state must
discard the shared AioSession, re-resolve the chain behind a fresh
session, retry, and land the write - not lose the batch.

A lost batch is the worst credential failure mode this storage has:
add_reservations raises, the updater logs and drops the item (there is
no requeue), and other pods then report the just-created network
not-found. Covered here for both faces of a rotation window:

  * InvalidToken - S3 rejects the request the batch's client signed
    with a bad resolved credential state (a ClientError; the same
    production failure the reader-path test in
    test_invalid_token_recovery.py pins, see nora-studio #1310).
  * NoCredentialsError - the chain behind the batch's fresh client
    resolved to nothing (credentials file caught empty mid-rewrite),
    raised locally by botocore at request-signing time. This is a
    BotoCoreError, NOT a ClientError: under a ClientError-only retry
    gate it escapes with retry budget unused and the batch is lost -
    the recovery test below fails exactly that way against such a gate.
