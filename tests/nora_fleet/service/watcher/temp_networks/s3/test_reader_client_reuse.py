"""
Pins the client-lifecycle cost of the reservation READ path: repeated
reads must reuse one long-lived S3 client, not build and tear one down
per call.

Why it matters: get_one_reservation() runs on the request path -
ExpiringAgentNetworkStorage.get_agent_network_provider() calls it on
every local-cache miss, and on EVERY request naming an unknown agent id
(negative lookups are never cached). A previous design (see issue
#1153) routed every read through a create-client/close cycle that:

  * acquired a worker-wide threading lock,
  * built a brand-new botocore client (~2ms warm, measured - endpoint
    resolution plus a fresh urllib3 pool), serialized under that lock, and
  * close()d the client in a finally block, discarding the connection
    pool - so every S3 GET paid a fresh TCP+TLS handshake and churned
    file descriptors / TIME_WAIT sockets under concurrent load.

Per-call clients are not required for credential correctness either:
AwsSyncClientWorker's long-lived client is created WITHOUT explicit
keys, so each request is signed through the session's
RefreshableCredentials, which botocore refreshes automatically at
signing time. (botocore clients are also thread-safe, so one client can
serve concurrent readers through its connection pool.)

This test was originally written red against the per-call design; it is
green with the long-lived client and guards against regressing to
one-client-per-read.
