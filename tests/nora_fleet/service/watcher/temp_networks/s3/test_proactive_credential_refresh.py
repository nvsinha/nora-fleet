"""
Pins credential-rotation behavior on the read path: when the credential
provider already holds a fresh token, an S3 operation must never be
attempted with a stale one.

How botocore handles this natively: a client created WITHOUT explicit
keys holds the session's credentials OBJECT and freezes it per request
at signing time; for token-based sources (IAM Instance Role, ECS Task
Role, SSO) that object is RefreshableCredentials, which checks its
expiry window on every request and refreshes itself BEFORE signing. A
long-lived keyless client therefore never presents an expired token to
S3 - refresh is proactive and costs zero failed calls.
AwsSyncClientWorker relies on exactly this (see its class docstring),
and this test pins both halves of that reliance: the client must be
created keylessly, and no request may go out with a stale token.

A previous design (see issue #1153) instead snapshotted ("froze") the
credentials once and passed the raw key/secret/token strings to
create_client - which makes botocore build a plain static Credentials
object with no refresh machinery. When the token expired, recovery was
REACTIVE: the next S3 call failed with ExpiredToken, and only then was
a new client built from a re-frozen token. Every token-expiry cycle
cost one real failed S3 round trip - on the request path, user-visible
latency plus error-log noise. This test was originally written red
against that design; it is green with keyless clients.
