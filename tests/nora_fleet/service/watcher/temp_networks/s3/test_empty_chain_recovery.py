"""
Pins recovery on the reservation READ path when the credential chain
resolves to NOTHING mid-rotation (e.g. a credentials file caught empty
while another process rewrites it).

This is the other face of the rotation window the ExpiredToken /
InvalidToken retry rides out: instead of S3 rejecting a request signed
with stale credentials (a ClientError), botocore itself raises
NoCredentialsError - a BotoCoreError - from the sync worker's
empty-chain guard in get_client(). A retry gate written as
"except ClientError" never sees that exception, so it would escape
retry_with_new_client with retry budget unused, sail past the reader's
ClientError/JSONDecodeError handlers, and fail the user's request
outright - even though the rewrite lands a second later and the loop
had backoff attempts to spare.

The widened gate catches NoCredentialsError/PartialCredentialsError
alongside ClientError and classifies them via
S3Util.is_credential_rejection_error: back off, let botocore re-resolve
the chain (a None resolution is never cached), and retry. Without the
widening, the recovery test below fails with NoCredentialsError
propagating out of get_one_reservation() after a single resolution.

        Scenario: the reader needs a client while the credential chain

        NoCredentialsError, the credential retry treats it as a
