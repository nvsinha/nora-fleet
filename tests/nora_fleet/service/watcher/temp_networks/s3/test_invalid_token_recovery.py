"""
Pins recovery from S3 rejecting a request's session token as
InvalidToken ("The provided token is malformed or otherwise invalid")
on the reservation READ path.

Motivation - a real production failure (nora-studio issue #1310,
"AND is sporadically broken"):

    S3ReservationsReader: S3 error processing reservation object <id>
    during sync: An error occurred (InvalidToken) when calling the
    GetObject operation: The provided token is malformed or otherwise
    invalid.

The user-visible symptom was a network that had just been created
coming back "not found": the reader's ClientError handler logged the
credential error and reported the reservation as missing. Under the
credential design of that era, the reset gate matched only
ExpiredToken, so an InvalidToken credential state was never invalidated
- every cache-miss read kept failing until a pod restart.

The widened gate (S3Util.is_credential_rejection_error) treats
InvalidToken like ExpiredToken: discard the session + client,
re-resolve the credential chain, and retry. Without the widening, the
recovery test below fails with get_one_reservation() returning
(None, None) after a single client construction - the exact #1310
failure mode.
