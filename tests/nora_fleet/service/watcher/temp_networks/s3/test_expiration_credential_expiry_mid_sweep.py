Pins the expiration sweep's recovery from AWS credentials expiring
MID-sweep - after the listing succeeded but before the per-object
get/delete calls complete.

When this can happen: AwsSyncClientWorker's long-lived client is
keyless, so token-based credentials (IAM Instance Roles, ECS Task
Roles, SSO) refresh at signing time and cannot expire mid-sweep. What
CAN still be rejected mid-sweep are STATIC credentials rotated
externally - env vars or a credentials file rewritten by another
process - which botocore resolves once per Session and never re-reads
on its own. The only recovery mechanism for those is reactive:
retry_with_new_client() wraps the whole sweep, and when an ExpiredToken
ClientError reaches it, it discards the session + client and re-runs
the sweep with a freshly resolved credential chain.

The failure mode this test guards against: if ExpiredToken errors
raised by the per-object get_object calls are caught by
expire_one_reservation's broad except-ClientError handler and merely
logged, the wrapper never sees them, so credentials are never
refreshed, every remaining key in the sweep makes exactly one doomed
S3 call, NOTHING is expired, and expire_reservations() returns as if
it succeeded. Expired reservations silently linger until a later
sweep's list_objects_v2 call happens to fail outside the swallowing
handler.

        Scenario: the sweep's client was built from a token that S3
        rejects by the time the per-object get_object calls run.

        Simulation:
          * get_object raises ClientError(ExpiredToken) while the
            token_state flag is set (it starts True).
          * Session.create_client is re-patched so that the SECOND
            client built under this test's patch "refreshes" the token
            (flips the flag) - modeling production, where
            retry_with_new_client discards the session + client and the
            re-resolved credential chain hands back a fresh token.

        Expected: the ExpiredToken propagates out of the per-object
        handling to retry_with_new_client, which rebuilds the client and
        re-runs the sweep; every expired reservation is deleted.

        If expire_one_reservation swallows the ExpiredToken per key
        instead of re-raising it, both assertions fail: the client is
        never rebuilt and all three expired objects remain while the
        sweep reports success.
