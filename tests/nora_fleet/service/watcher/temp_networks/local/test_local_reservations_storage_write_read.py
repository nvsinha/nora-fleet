Write/read round-trip tests for LocalReservationsStorage.

Covers: write-then-read of a valid reservation, non-mutation of the
caller's agent_spec, empty-batch no-op, missing-reservation returns
(None, None), and the documented read-path contract that an already-
expired reservation is reported as absent.
