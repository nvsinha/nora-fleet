class McpToolErrorHandler:
    """
    Holder of an async_invoke bound method that stands in for an MCP tool's
    coroutine in order to catch errors raised while calling the MCP server.
    See https://github.com/nvsinha/nora-fleet/issues/1097

    Background:
    MCP tools arrive from langchain-mcp-adapters as plain StructuredTool
    instances whose async implementation lives in their "coroutine" attribute.
    LangChain executes such a tool by calling "await tool.coroutine(**args)".
    Nothing in that stack handles errors: if the MCP call raises (an HTTP 504
    from a gateway timeout, a connection failure, or a ToolException from an
    MCP error result), the exception escapes the tool, and langgraph's ToolNode
    re-raises anything that is not a ToolInvocationError. That aborts the whole
    agent chain run, and the client receives "Agent stopped due to exception..."
    instead of an answer.

    The fix:
    LangChainMcpAdapter replaces each MCP tool's coroutine attribute with the
    async_invoke *bound method* of an instance of this class. The instance
    captures the original coroutine at construction time, and the bound method
    is a drop-in replacement for it: calling it returns an awaitable, which is
    the entire contract the coroutine attribute has to satisfy.

    It must be a real (bound) method rather than the instance itself with an
    async __call__: when building the agent, langgraph's ToolNode passes the
    tool's coroutine to typing.get_type_hints() while scanning for injected
    arguments, and get_type_hints() only accepts modules, classes, methods,
    or functions. A callable instance makes agent construction raise
    "TypeError: ... is not a module, class, method, or function"
    (observed with langgraph 1.2.9; langgraph 1.2.4 did not do this scan).

    When the tool is invoked, async_invoke awaits the original coroutine inside
    a try/except. Success passes through untouched. On failure, the exception is
    converted into a normal "Error: <message>" *return value*, so from
    langgraph's point of view the tool ran fine and simply reported an error.
    The agent chain keeps running, and the LLM can react to the failure
    (retry, rephrase, or explain it) instead of the run dying.

    This mirrors how CodedTool errors are handled in
    AbstractClassActivation.attempt_invoke(): the concise exception message
    goes back to the LLM, while the full traceback stays in the server logs only.

        Captures the tool's original coroutine, so instances must be created
        *before* their async_invoke method is assigned as the tool's coroutine.

        back to async_invoke itself and recurse forever.
