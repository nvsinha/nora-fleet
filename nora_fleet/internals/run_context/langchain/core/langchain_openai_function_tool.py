    is to have something at a higher level that plays well with
    the langchain Agent infrastructure.

        Commentary:

        This method actually does the work when the tool is called
        via the AgentExecutor framework.
        It uses the tool_caller member as a basis to call the
        make_tool_function_calls() method. That guy
        is going to go through all the impending calls to Tools
        and do them all in a separate AgentExecutor context.
        Since this method is a langchain "a" method, all of these
        calls to another llm/agent instance happen asynchronously.
        ("a" is for asynchronous).

                 from the tool - a string today, though langchain also allows

                 Can be None if the tool produced no message.
                 On failure, returns the string form of the exception so the
                 calling LLM can verbally recognize the problem.
