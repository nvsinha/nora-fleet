        #       Dict[str, Any] is used here rather than bare Any because of
        #       the JSON schema each produces for the LLM provider:
        #       * Any yields an empty schema ({}), which provider adapters

        #         (every version tested, 2.1.8 through 4.3.2) defaults such
        #         untyped properties to STRING, after which Gemini sends
        #         JSON-encoded strings where tools expect dictionaries.
        #       * Dict[str, Any] yields
        #         {"type": "object", "additionalProperties": true},
        #         which converts to a proper OBJECT declaration everywhere.

        #       For well-formed arguments the two behave identically: a
        #       dictionary sent by the LLM reaches the tool as the same
        #       plain dict.  Non-dict values (e.g. a JSON-encoded string),

          names collide with create_model()'s own keyword arguments.

          configuration argument instead of becoming a field.
        * Names that shadow a BaseModel method inside pydantic's protected
          namespaces "model_dump" and "model_validate" (e.g. "model_dump",
          "model_dump_json", "model_validate_json").  Other "model_"-prefixed
          names (e.g. "model_name") are fine.

        Deliberately NOT rejected here: names that shadow BaseModel
        attributes outside the protected namespaces, such as "schema",
        "json", "dict" or "copy".  Pydantic v2 creates those fields and only
        emits a shadowing UserWarning, so they work.  This is itself a
        behavior change from the v1-based converter: v1's create_model
        raised NameError for them, which made network validation reject
        such specs - they now pass.
