class ToolboxFactory(ContextTypeToolboxFactory):
    """
    A factory class for creating instances of various tools defined in the toolbox.

    This class provides an interface to instantiate different tools based on the specified langchain base tools
    and predefined coded tools.

    This approach standardizes tool creation and simplifies integration with agents requiring predefined tools.

    ### Extending the Class

        To integrate additional tools, add a tool configuration file in JSON or HOCON format
        and set its path to the environment variable "AGENT_TOOLBOX_INFO_FILE".

        The configuration should follow this structure

        for langchain's tools:
        - The tool name serves as a key.
        - The corresponding value should be a dictionary with:
        - "class": The fully qualified class name of the tool in the form
            "<package_name>.<module_name>.<ClassName>".
        - "args": A dictionary of arguments required for the tool's initialization,
            which may include nested class configurations.

        for coded tools:
        - The tool name serves as a key.
        - The corresponding value should be a dictionary with:
        - "class": Module and class in the format of tool_module.ClassName where tool_module is in
                    AGENT_TOOL_PATH or nora_fleet/coded_tools.
        - "description": When and how to use the tool.
        - "parameters": Information on arguments of the tool.
            See "parameters" in https://github.com/nvsinha/nora-fleet/blob/main/docs/agent_hocon_reference.md

        The default toolbox config file can be seen at
        "nora_fleet/internals/run_context/langchain/toolbox/toolbox_info.hocon"
