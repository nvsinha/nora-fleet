        Globally register the Langfuse CallbackHandler, if available.
        This is really the only way we can do this with langchain managing span parentage.

        Called from the constructor rather than at class-load time so that
        registration (and the Langfuse client the handler constructs from the
        LANGFUSE_* env vars) only happens when a LangfuseTracingContext is
        actually created - that is, when LANGFUSE_ENABLED is true per the
        LangChainTracingContextFactory.  Merely installing langfuse with keys
        in the environment must not start exporting traces.

        Caveat: registration is a process-lifetime one-way door.  Once the
        first enabled request has registered the handler with langchain,
        flipping LANGFUSE_ENABLED to false in the same process only stops the
        per-request wrapping (root AGENT span, session/user metadata) - the
        already-registered handler keeps exporting bare traces until the
        process is restarted.  For LANGFUSE_ENABLED to fully disable tracing
        it must be false before the process constructs its first
        LangfuseTracingContext - operationally, false from process start.

        :return: The ContextVar carrying the langfuse callback handler.
        :raises ValueError: (from ResolverUtil) when langfuse tracing is
                wanted but the langfuse package is not installed, with the
                standard "pip install" guidance in the message.  Nothing is
                cached in that case, so the next construction retries the
                resolution - a transient import failure must not poison
                tracing for the rest of the process.
