        #   LLM calls made by all downstream agents - including agents of same-server
        #   external networks invoked through direct sessions. The handler's scalar
        #   totals (total_tokens et al) are therefore cumulative over this agent's
        #   whole subtree, and a front man's totals cover the entire request.
        # * The handler's models_token_dict is different: it only counts LLM calls
        #   belonging to this agent itself (see LlmTokenCallbackHandler._is_own_call()),
        #   so that report() below can accumulate per-model stats into request_reporting
        #   with each call counted exactly once, no matter how deeply agents nest.
        # * External agents on *remote* servers handle their own requests in a separate
        #   context and are not seen by this handler at all.
        # Note on cancellation: if this task is cancelled outright (e.g. client
        # disconnect), CancelledError propagates and report() below never runs -
