    An AbstractCommonDefsConfigFilter implementation that takes a agent tool
    registry config that may or may not contain commondefs definitions

        "commondefs": {
            "replacement_values": {
                "foo": {

                }
            }
        }

    This ConfigFilter implementation will replace any value of the string value "foo"
    with the full dictionary { "bar": 1 }.
