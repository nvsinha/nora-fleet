class LlmConfigToolSelectorMiddleware(LLMToolSelectorMiddleware):
    """
    LLMToolSelectorMiddleware implementation that understands nora-fleet LLM Configs.

    This can significantly reduce token and time costs for agent trees that were deep
    and which can be flattened. But note that these improvements come at a cost of flexibility
    in federation and less complete answers.  Completeness in answers will depend much more on
    the descriptions of the leaf agents.

    Unlike the langchain superclass, this middleware also enforces the selection at
    tool-execution time.  The superclass only narrows the tool list *advertised* to the
    model per call; the agent executor is still built with the full tool list, so a tool
    call naming a de-selected tool (e.g. a name the model remembered from an earlier turn)
    would otherwise still execute.  To close that gap:

    * awrap_model_call() records, per tool call id, the tool names that were advertised
      to the model on the call that produced it.  The record is kept in sly_data
      (or a private per-instance dictionary when sly_data is not provided), outside
      of langgraph agent state, so other middleware that rewrite messages cannot
      disturb it.
    * awrap_tool_call() rejects any tool call whose name was not among the tools
      advertised on the model call that produced it, returning an error ToolMessage
      instead of executing, so the model can retry.

    Tool calls with no recorded advertisement (e.g. produced by another middleware
    short-circuiting the model call) are allowed through with a warning by default,
    since we cannot know what was advertised for them.  Set unadvertised_policy to
    "deny" to reject such tool calls instead — recommended for agents exposed to
    untrusted input, at the cost of rejecting tool calls fabricated by co-resident
    middleware that bypass the model.

    This middleware does not support dynamic tools: the enforcement records the tool
    list as narrowed at this middleware's layer, so any middleware listed after it
    (composed inside it) that adds or removes tools via request.override(tools=...)
    will make the record diverge from what the model actually saw — added tools get
    falsely denied, removals go unenforced.  If other tool-modifying middleware must
    be combined with this one, list them before this middleware, and do not list any
    tool-modifying middleware after it.

    Only the async hooks are overridden, as nora-fleet always drives agents through
    the async path. Synchronous agent invocation raises NotImplementedError from the
    langchain superclass machinery at the first tool call.

    Note that LLM-based tool selection remains a token/latency optimization, not a
    security boundary: the selection model chooses tools based on the (untrusted) last
    user message, so it can be steered toward any configured tool.  Enforcement makes
    "advertised" equal "executable"; it does not make the selector an access-control
    mechanism.  The set of tools configured for the agent is the actual capability
    boundary: do not configure sensitive tools on agents exposed to untrusted input
    and rely on tool selection to keep those tools out of reach.
