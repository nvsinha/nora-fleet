class DebugGcHandler(RequestHandler):
    """
    Handler class for the /debug/gc endpoint.

    Forces a full Python garbage collection sweep (all generations) in the
    worker process that handles the request. Reports:

      - Number of objects collected across all generations.
      - Duration of the collection in milliseconds.
      - Process memory (RSS and VMS) before and after the sweep, plus the
        RSS delta (negative = memory freed).

    Response format is JSON. Pass ?format=text for a human-readable rendering.

    Gated behind ENABLE_RUN_TIME_STATISTICS -- same env var that gates
    /debug/tasks, /profiler and /resources_utilization -- so it is NOT
    reachable in production by default.

    Multi-worker note: gc.collect() is process-local. When nora-fleet runs
    with multiple Tornado worker processes (AGENT_HTTP_SERVER_INSTANCES > 1),
    each call to this endpoint only forces GC in the ONE worker that
    handled the request. The kernel routes accepted connections across
    workers, so probing every worker requires several sequential calls (or
    per-worker port access).

    Diagnostic-only note: gc.collect() holds the GIL for its entire
    duration, pausing every thread in this worker. Typical durations on a
    healthy process are < 100 ms; loaded processes with many live objects
    can push into seconds. Do not call this repeatedly on a busy production
    server.
