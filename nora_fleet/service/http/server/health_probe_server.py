class HealthProbeServer(Startable):
    """
    Runs the /, /healthz, /readyz, /livez health-probe endpoints on a
    dedicated port, in a dedicated OS thread with its own asyncio event
    loop. This isolates probe responsiveness from the main Tornado loop
    that serves streaming_chat and other request traffic -- so probes
    keep returning quickly even when the main loop is saturated by
    request work.

    The probe server binds its port with SO_REUSEPORT, so every worker
    process can bind the same port and the kernel distributes accepted
    connections across them. This matches the model used for the main
    server's port (server.bind() + server.start(N)).

    Lifecycle:
      - The instance is created before Tornado's server.start(N) fork.
      - Its start() (invoked as a Startable inside each worker, after
        fork) launches a background thread that:
          * creates a fresh asyncio event loop for itself,
          * builds a minimal Tornado Application with only the health
            handlers,
          * binds the probe port with reuse_port=True,
          * runs its IOLoop until process exit.
      - Because it's post-fork and daemon-threaded, no selector/kqueue
        state is inherited from the parent and process exit tears it
        down cleanly.

    Disabling: pass port=0 (or set AGENT_HEALTH_PROBE_PORT=0) to skip
    starting the separate server. In that case k8s / load-balancer
    probes must still hit the main port's handlers, which remain
    registered for backward compatibility.
