class LoopTimelineTracer:
    """
    sys.setprofile-based tracer that records a linear timeline of activity
    on a single asyncio event-loop thread.

    Every scheduled unit of work an asyncio loop runs -- task steps, done
    callbacks, call_soon callbacks, timer callbacks -- flows through
    asyncio.events.Handle._run(). By hooking that function's call/return
    events via sys.setprofile, this tracer captures:

      - When each scheduled unit of work started.
      - When it returned (i.e. yielded back to the loop, or finished).
      - What it was: a Task step (with the task's name) or a plain
        callback (with the callback's qualname).

    Reading a snapshot back gives you a sequence like:

        call   task_step  streaming_chat.post   t=0.000ms
        return                                  t=0.140ms
        call   callback   _add_ready_callback   t=0.145ms
        return                                  t=0.148ms
        call   task_step  agent_chat_loop       t=0.200ms
        return                                  t=1.310ms   <- this task hogged 1.1ms
        ...

    which directly answers "what is occupying my loop?"

    Design notes:
      * Ring buffer (collections.deque with maxlen) bounds memory. Old events
        drop off the front as new ones arrive.
      * The profile callback is deliberately minimal to keep tracing overhead
        low; expensive introspection (peeking at frame locals) happens only
        on 'call' events for the specific Handle._run frame.
      * f_code identity comparison (frame.f_code is _handle_run_code) is
        O(1) and avoids string matching in the hot path.
      * sys.setprofile is per-thread. This tracer must be started on the
        thread whose loop you want to trace (typically the Tornado main
        loop thread, right before IOLoop.current().start()).

    Cost: ~5-10% loop overhead depending on callback density. Fine for
    diagnostic runs and manageable for production if you keep the buffer
    small.
