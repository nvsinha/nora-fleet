class HttpxLlmTracer:
    """
    HTTP-layer tracer for outbound LLM traffic that flows through
    httpx.AsyncClient. Emits structured JSON log events so post-run
    analysis (grep, jq, pandas) can reconstruct per-request lifecycles.

    Events emitted (one line each, via the dedicated logger
    "nora_fleet.diagnostics.http_llm_trace"):

      - http_llm_out  : request sent. Fields include attempt_id,
                        provider (host-inferred), method, url, req_bytes,
                        user_req_id (from ContextVar).
      - http_llm_in   : response HEADERS received. Fields include the
                        same attempt_id, HTTP status, elapsed_ms since
                        out, and server_req_id (from openai-request-id
                        / x-request-id headers where present). For
                        streaming responses this is TTFT, not stream end.
      - http_llm_end  : response body FULLY consumed OR the response was
                        closed. Fields include attempt_id, elapsed_ms
                        (total), reason (stream_complete / aclose /
                        stream_error:<ExcType> / stream_generator_exit),
                        stream_bytes (total bytes read).
      - http_llm_chunk: (optional, per-chunk) one line per received body
                        chunk. Only emitted when
                        AGENT_HTTP_LLM_TRACE_CHUNKS is enabled -- log
                        volume is huge (dozens per LLM call).
      - http_llm_err  : (implicit) if the response never arrives, only
                        http_llm_out is emitted; readers detect missing
                        http_llm_in / http_llm_end as errors. Explicit
                        transport failures inside body iteration are
                        surfaced via http_llm_end with reason
                        "stream_error:...".

    Every event carries "user_req_id" read from a ContextVar. Set the
    ContextVar at the boundary of each user-facing request (e.g. in the
    Tornado handler entry point) via set_user_request_id(); asyncio and
    executor bridges propagate context automatically, so every LLM call
    triggered downstream will inherit the same id.

    Correlation:
      grep 'user_req_id=<id>' http_llm_trace.log  gives the whole LLM
      lifecycle of one user request in time order, with attempt_ids
      grouping any retries.

    Installation is one-shot: call install(...) once at server startup,
    before any LLM client is constructed. install() monkey-patches
    httpx.AsyncClient.__init__ to inject event_hooks on every future
    client, regardless of which provider SDK creates it. Idempotent --
    a second call is a no-op.

    Env vars:
    AGENT_HTTP_LLM_TRACE (default "false") — master toggle. When enabled, installs the tracer on server startup.
    AGENT_HTTP_LLM_TRACE_INCLUDE_BODIES (default "false") — capture request/response bodies verbatim
            (capped at 64 KB each).
            Prompts and completions are large and often sensitive; off by default.
    AGENT_HTTP_LLM_TRACE_CHUNKS (default "false") — emit one event per received body chunk.
            Massive log volume (dozens of chunks per streaming LLM call);
            enable only when investigating inter-chunk cadence.

    ================================================================
    Coding-policy notes (per nora-fleet team standards)
    ================================================================
    All helpers are class-level static or classmethods. No nested /
    embedded functions inside methods -- state that would normally live
    in closures instead lives on:
      - response.extensions[...] : per-response state (end_emitted flag,
                                   iter_started flag, saved original
                                   aiter_raw / aclose, buffered body).
      - request.extensions[...]  : per-request state (attempt_id, start_ns).
      - class attributes         : per-installation state
                                   (_original_httpx_init, _include_*, _logger).
    functools.partial is used to bind response into the response-scoped
    wrappers (_wrapped_aiter_raw, _wrapped_aclose) at assignment time.

    ================================================================
    Known limitations / future work
    ================================================================
    1. httpx transport only. Providers using non-httpx clients (notably
       AWS Bedrock via aiobotocore, and any future gRPC-based provider
       path such as Vertex AI direct) bypass this tracer. Extending to
       Bedrock requires registering hooks on botocore's event system;
       see BOTOCORE_SESSION.register('before-send.*', ...) as the
       entry point.

    2. Stream-body capture (when AGENT_HTTP_LLM_TRACE_INCLUDE_BODIES
       is enabled) truncates each body at 64 KB. Increase the cap or
       stream to a separate file if full-body capture is required.
       The truncation is intentional to keep single log lines bounded
       for downstream parsers (jq, pandas).

    3. Free-threaded Python (cpython-3.14t) compatibility: the tracer
       itself has no C dependencies and works cleanly on 3.14t. Some
       dependent packages that the nora-fleet dep graph pulls in
       (notably orjson) refuse to build for the free-threaded ABI at
       the time of writing. Use a stdlib-json shim for orjson or
       wait for upstream support if running under free-threaded Python.

    4. Tornado-loop-only ContextVar propagation is guaranteed by
       Python's asyncio internals. Any future non-asyncio bridge
       (e.g., a raw threading.Thread that runs LLM calls without
       contextvars.copy_context) would drop the user_req_id and
       events would emit with user_req_id=None. Not a current concern
       for nora-fleet, but flag it if such a bridge is added.

    5. Per-attempt correlation only. This tracer does not add a
       parent-span concept. Each httpx retry appears as an independent
       attempt_id under the same user_req_id; post-processing must
       infer retry chains by proximity and URL match. If tighter
       correlation becomes necessary, add an "attempt_parent_id"
       field populated from a request extension set by upstream SDK
       retry logic (where available).
