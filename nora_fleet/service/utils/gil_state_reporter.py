class GilStateReporter:
    """
    Reports the current state of the CPython Global Interpreter Lock at server
    startup, so logs make it unambiguous whether a process is actually running
    free-threaded (no-GIL) or not.

    Three independent facts determine GIL behavior; this reports all of them:
      * free-threaded BUILD  -- is this a 3.13t/3.14t interpreter at all
                                (sysconfig "Py_GIL_DISABLED")?
      * runtime GIL state    -- is the GIL enabled right now
                                (sys._is_gil_enabled(), Python 3.13+)? On a
                                free-threaded build this can be True because a
                                loaded C/Rust extension that is not free-thread
                                safe caused CPython to re-enable it.
      * PYTHON_GIL override   -- "0" forces the GIL off, "1" forces it on,
                                unset lets the interpreter decide.

    Note the runtime state is point-in-time: on a free-threaded build with
    PYTHON_GIL unset, importing a not-yet-safe extension LATER can still flip the
    GIL back on. Report after the bulk of imports (e.g. at server startup) for
    the most representative reading; PYTHON_GIL=0 makes the reading definitive.
