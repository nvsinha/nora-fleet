class Authorizer:
    """
    An interface for authorization.

    Note that _authorization_ - the ability to determine permission to access a resource (in
    Nora Fleet's case an agent network) - is not to be confused with _authentication_ -
    the ability to determine a user's identity.  Normally, authentication is done by
    a system outside the scope of a Nora Fleet server, like by a load-balancer for a cluster.

    The methods here are based on what we need from what packages like OpenFGA or Oso provide,
    that is to assist in answering the question: "Does Actor X have Persmission Y on Resource Z?"
    It is assumed at this level that the identity of Actor X has already been authenticated
    outside the scope of a Nora Fleet server, if that is desired and necessary.
