        Safely extract the Error.Code from a botocore ClientError response.

        Why this exists: DictionaryExtractor.get() only applies its default when
        a key is *missing* along the path. When the terminal key is present with
        a stored value of None, that None is returned in preference to the
        default. botocore's REST-XML parser can produce exactly that for S3
        error bodies with an empty <Code/> element (and S3-compatible
        endpoints/test doubles can too), so code like
            "ExpiredToken" not in extractor.get("Error.Code", "")
        raises TypeError ("argument of type 'NoneType' is not iterable") inside
        an exception handler, replacing the real S3 error with a TypeError.
        This helper guarantees a str so substring/equality checks are safe.

        :return: True if the error means the resolved credential state is
                 unusable in a way that discarding the Session + client and
                 re-resolving the credential chain can plausibly fix:

                 * ExpiredToken / ExpiredTokenException - the session token
                   has expired. For keyless clients this stays dormant for
                   role/SSO sources (they refresh at signing time) and fires
                   for static session tokens rotated externally.
                 * InvalidToken - "malformed or otherwise invalid": the token
                   S3 received does not hang together, e.g. a credential
                   state captured mid-rotation or a revoked role session.
                   Clients are created WITHOUT explicit keys, so our code
                   never assembles a key/secret/token triple itself - this
                   code can only mean the resolved credential state is bad,
                   and re-resolution is the only remedy. Observed in
                   production (nora-studio issue #1310): an InvalidToken
                   state persisted across reads precisely because the
                   previous design's reset gate matched only ExpiredToken.
                   Exact match on purpose; there is no InvalidTokenException
                   variant for S3, and near-misses like InvalidClientTokenId
                   belong to other services.
                 * TokenRefreshRequired - "the provided token must be
                   refreshed": S3's third temporary-token rejection code.
                   Same remedy as its siblings - only a re-resolved chain
                   can supply a refreshed token. Exact match, like
                   InvalidToken.
                 * NoCredentialsError / PartialCredentialsError - raised
                   locally by botocore (not sent by S3) when the chain
                   resolves to nothing or to an incomplete key set: the
                   other face of the same rotation window, a credentials
                   file caught empty or half-written mid-rewrite. These are
                   BotoCoreErrors, NOT ClientErrors, so callers must catch
                   them alongside ClientError for this classification to
                   matter (a plain "except ClientError" gate never sees
                   them). botocore never caches a None resolution, so
                   retrying once the rewrite lands heals the state.

                 Deliberately NOT matched: InvalidAccessKeyId and
                 SignatureDoesNotMatch. Those indicate rotated long-lived
                 key pairs or genuine signing bugs - retrying would mask
                 real misconfiguration (see the workers' retry docstrings).

        Single, shared policy point for parsing the reservation block out of an
        agent-spec object read back from S3.

        Before this helper, each consumer had its own ad-hoc handling of
        malformed content, and the policies contradicted each other:
          * S3ReservationsReader defaulted to {} and built a bogus Reservation
            (id=None, expiration=None) whose expiration=None later crashed
            request handling with "'>' not supported between float and NoneType".
          * S3ReservationsExpiration defaulted expiration_time to 0, which made
            "malformed" indistinguishable from "expired at epoch" and silently
            DELETED the object.
        Centralizing the shape check means both consumers agree on what a
        well-formed reservation looks like; each caller decides what a None
        return means for it (reader: treat as not-found; expiration:
        age-gated handling - skip and warn while the object is young, delete
        once it is older than any reservation could live; see
        S3ReservationsExpiration.handle_malformed_object for that policy).

        Note on DictionaryExtractor semantics: its .get() only applies the
        default when a key is missing. A stored JSON null (e.g.
        {"metadata": {"reservation": null}}) is returned as None in preference
        to the default - that exact shape still crashed the expiration sweep
        with "'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'" even after
        DictionaryExtractor was introduced. That is why the isinstance checks
        below cannot be replaced with extractor defaults.

                 NOT required: it is only used for logging, and requiring it
                 would strand legacy objects that lack one.
