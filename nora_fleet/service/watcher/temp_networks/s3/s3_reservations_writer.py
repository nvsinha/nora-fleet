    AWS S3-based class that writes reservations out to persistent store
    managed by S3ReservationsStorage.

    Stores reservations as JSON objects in an S3 bucket, with each reservation
    stored in its associated agent spec as metadata.

    The main entry point here is add_reservations(), which eventually gets called from the
    TempNetworkStorageUpdater.process_one_queued_item() method via the
    AbstractAgentReservationist.deploy_together() method.
    These calls happen from their own asyncio EventLoop, very separate from the reads and expirations
    also managed by S3ReservationsStorage.

            preserved; this method merges into agent_spec["metadata"]
            rather than replacing it.
          * lifetime_in_seconds:        client-requested duration.
          * expiration_time_in_seconds: now + min(lifetime, server max);
                                        Unix timestamp the system enforces against.
          * stored_at:                  time.time() at write; useful for
                                        clock-skew audit and orphan detection.
