class AwsSyncClientWorker:
    """
    Class that manages a particular AWS boto synchronous work_function
    (from functools.partial) that has sync_aws_client as an argument,
    supplying it with a single long-lived botocore client.

    Credential handling is delegated to botocore by creating the client
    WITHOUT explicit keys: such a client holds the session's credential
    OBJECT and freezes it per request at signing time. For token-based
    credential sources (IAM Instance Role, ECS Task Role, AWS SSO/IAM
    Identity Center) that object is RefreshableCredentials, which checks
    its expiry window on every request and refreshes itself BEFORE
    signing - so a long-lived keyless client never presents an expired
    token to S3, and token rotation costs zero failed calls.
    See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/boto3/latest/guide/credentials.html

    The previous design instead froze the session's credentials once and
    passed the raw key/secret/token to create_client() - which makes
    botocore build a static Credentials object with NO refresh machinery -
    and created/closed a client around every work_function call,
    discarding the client's urllib3 connection pool each time. That put
    client construction (serialized under a worker-wide lock) plus a
    fresh TCP+TLS handshake on every S3 call, on a read path that runs
    per request for reservation-cache misses, and made token-expiry
    recovery reactive: one real failed ExpiredToken round trip per expiry
    cycle. See issue #1153.
    """

    # The one long-lived client serves ALL concurrent readers through its
    # connection pool. botocore's default pool holds only 10 connections
    # (with urllib3 block=False), so any concurrency beyond that silently
    # opens a fresh TCP+TLS connection per request and discards it on
    # release ("Connection pool is full" warnings) - exactly the handshake
    # cost this long-lived client exists to avoid. Size the pool for the
    # server's request-thread concurrency instead.

    # because each attempt re-resolves the full credential chain (possibly

        Calls work_function with this worker's long-lived S3 client,
        retrying with a rebuilt session + client should S3 reject the
        credentials a request was signed with.

        Because the client is keyless (see class docstring), token-based
        credentials refresh at signing time and this retry path stays
        dormant for them. It fires when the resolved credential state is
        unusable (see S3Util.is_credential_rejection_error):
          * ExpiredToken - static session tokens rotated externally, e.g.
            temporary credentials in a credentials file that another
            process rewrites. botocore resolves the credential chain once
            per Session and never re-reads that file on its own, so the
            only way to pick up the new values is to discard the session
            and client and re-resolve from scratch (reset_client()).
          * InvalidToken - a malformed/mismatched credential state (e.g.
            captured mid-rotation, or a revoked role session). Our code
            never assembles key/secret/token triples itself, so this can
            only mean the resolved credential state is bad; re-resolution
            is the only remedy. Observed in production (nora-studio
            issue #1310): such a state persisted across reads precisely
            because the previous design's gate matched only ExpiredToken.
          * TokenRefreshRequired - S3's third temporary-token rejection
            code ("the provided token must be refreshed"); same remedy
            as its siblings above.
          * NoCredentialsError / PartialCredentialsError - BotoCoreErrors
            raised locally when the chain resolves empty or half-written
            (that same credentials file caught mid-rewrite): the other
            face of the rotation window the codes above catch after the
            fact. Caught here alongside ClientError - a ClientError-only
            gate would let them escape with retry budget unused and fail
            the request outright.
        Two rotation cases deliberately do NOT recover here: environment
        variables (a process's environment cannot be changed from outside,
        so re-resolving would re-read the same values), and rotated access
        KEY PAIRS (S3 rejects those with InvalidAccessKeyId or
        SignatureDoesNotMatch - widening the gate to match them would make
        genuine misconfiguration and signing bugs retry instead of
        surfacing). Both of those require a process restart.

        keep the retry policies in sync when editing.
