class AwsAsyncClientWorker:
    """
    Class that manages a particular AWS boto async work_function (from functools.partial)
    that has async_aws_client as an argument, supplying it with an aiobotocore
    client created per call.

    Credential handling is delegated to aiobotocore by creating the client
    WITHOUT explicit keys: such a client holds the session's credential
    OBJECT and freezes it per request at signing time. For token-based
    credential sources (IAM Instance Role, ECS Task Role, AWS SSO/IAM
    Identity Center) that object is refreshable, checks its expiry window on
    every request, and refreshes itself BEFORE signing - so the client never
    presents an expired token to S3. The previous design passed a frozen
    key/secret/token snapshot to create_client(), which pins static
    credentials with no refresh machinery. See issue #1153.

    Unlike AwsSyncClientWorker (whose client serves the per-request read hot
    path and is therefore long-lived), this worker still creates its client
    per work_function call: aiobotocore clients are async context managers
    whose lifetime must be managed inside the event loop that uses them, the
    writer that owns this worker has no stop() hook at which a long-lived
    context could be exited cleanly, and the write path runs per deployment
    batch - not per request - so client construction is not a hot-path cost
    here.

        Retries the async work_function when client credentials can expire.

        Because clients are created keyless (see class docstring),
        token-based credentials refresh at signing time and this retry path
        stays dormant for them. It fires when the resolved credential state
        is unusable (see S3Util.is_credential_rejection_error):
        ExpiredToken (static session tokens rotated externally - e.g. a
        credentials file rewritten by another process, which the chain
        resolves once per Session and never re-reads on its own),
        InvalidToken (a malformed/mismatched credential state - our code
        never assembles key/secret/token triples itself, so this can only
        mean the resolved credential state is bad; observed in production
        as nora-studio issue #1310), TokenRefreshRequired (S3's third
        temporary-token rejection code; same remedy), and
        NoCredentialsError/PartialCredentialsError (BotoCoreErrors raised
        locally when the chain resolves empty or half-written - that same
        credentials file caught mid-rewrite - which a ClientError-only
        gate would let escape and lose the whole write batch with retry
        budget unused). Two rotation cases deliberately do NOT recover
        here: environment variables (a process's environment cannot be
        changed from outside, so re-resolving would re-read the same
        values), and rotated access KEY PAIRS (S3 rejects those with
        InvalidAccessKeyId or SignatureDoesNotMatch). Both require a
        process restart.
