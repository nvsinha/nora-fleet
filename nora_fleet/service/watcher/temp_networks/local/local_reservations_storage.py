"""
Local-filesystem implementation of the reservations storage interface.

Mirrors the semantics of S3ReservationsStorage / S3ReservationsWriter /
S3ReservationsReader / S3ReservationsExpiration, but persists each
reservation as a JSON file under a configurable local directory. Intended
for single-node deployments, tests, and local development where standing
up S3 is overkill.

On-disk layout:
    <base_path>/<reservation_id>.json

On-disk JSON schema per reservation (same as the S3 variant):
    {
        "name": ...,
        "llm_config": ...,
        "tools": ...,
        ...                          # any other agent_spec top-level fields
        "metadata": {
            ...                                          # user-authored metadata (merged in)
            "reservation": {
                "id": <str>,
                "lifetime_in_seconds": <float>,
                "expiration_time_in_seconds": <float>,
            },
